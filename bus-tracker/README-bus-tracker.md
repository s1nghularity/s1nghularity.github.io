# Boston Bus Tracker

This was a challenging exercise that required us to understand how to separate large amount of data into something meaningful. In this case it is the live locations of busses in the MIT/Harvard area. Using both Google Maps API and MTA API we are able to overlay the live locations of the busses on a map.

## Run Code

From github, download this repository and **open the index.html** file or go to s1nghularity.github.com. It may not work if the API key isn't functional - if you put your own API key in it should work. 


## Future Changes

No future plans to modify exercise.
