# Map Animation

With the MapBox API loaded into the header, we were tasked with marking the bus route from MIT to Harvard. Used MapBox to place a marker at the start of the route and to center the map. Then a *for loop* to run through all the coordinates. Click the button which says 'SHOW STOPS FROM SAINIK FARMS TO NDTV'. This maps a route I took daily when working in New Delhi as a journalist in a former life. I also added a customized button credit @adamgiebl from uiverse.io

## Run Code

From github, download this repository and **open the index.html** file in a local server or go to s1nghularity.github.io/personal-portfolio/

## Future Changes

Include the NDTV logo as a map marker and break up app into HTML, CSS & JS
