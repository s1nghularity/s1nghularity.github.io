# Eye Movement 

We were already given a single eye which tracked the document.onmousemove event to create movement of the pupil AKA div class = ball. By duplicating the existing *eye* CSS class (along with the div *ball* attributes) and encapsulating them both in a parent class of *eyes* we complete the assignment.
