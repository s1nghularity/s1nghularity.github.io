# Pacmen Factory

The modification of the DIV and DOM continues, incorporating an old pac-man exercise. This time a button would create a pac-man with a random velocity and position every time it was pressed. The pacmen will only move once the 'start' button is pressed and would face the opposite direction upon hitting the browser edge.

## Run Code

From github, download this repository and **open the index.html** file in a local server or go to s1nghularity.github.io/personal-portfolio/

## Future Changes

Fix image so it only changes direction when hitting the right or left border, not top or bottom.

Big thanks to classmate @Ilya Flaks for his help.
